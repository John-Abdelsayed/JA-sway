Sway Configuration Files

## Issues

Parts of this config file have been taken from too many sources to possible list.
If I have borrowed from your work and havent given you credit, please send an email to john.aziz@dtig.us and I will rectify it immediately.

## Thanks

- EndeavourOS team for the parts that I migrated from swaywm.
- @rbnis for some of the sway aspects
